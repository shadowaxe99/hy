Make me an auto wikipedia editor and writer. It would use chatgt 4 with api key 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 to run. it should be able to edit a specific person and you can point it to a url or keyword surronded what you want to add or a compeltely new page that it would source write it and submit it properly sourced

To create an auto Wikipedia editor and writer, we will need to install the necessary dependencies and set up the project. Here are the steps to get started:

Create a new folder for the project.
Install the required dependencies using the following shell command:
pip install chatgt
Create a new Python file, let's name it wiki_editor.py, in the project folder.
In the wiki_editor.py file, import the necessary libraries and set up the ChatGPT API key. Here's an example code snippet:
import openai

# Set up the ChatGPT API key
openai.api_key = "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"
Define a function to edit a specific person's Wikipedia page. This function will take the person's name, the content to be added, and the URL or keyword to locate the section to edit. Here's an example code snippet:
def edit_wikipedia_page(person_name, content, url_or_keyword):
    # TODO: Implement the logic to edit the Wikipedia page
    pass
Implement the logic inside the edit_wikipedia_page function to interact with the ChatGPT API and perform the necessary edits. You can use the openai.Completion.create() method to generate the edited content. Here's an example code snippet:
def edit_wikipedia_page(person_name, content, url_or_keyword):
    # Generate the edited content using ChatGPT
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Edit {person_name}'s Wikipedia page to add:\n{content}\nURL or keyword: {url_or_keyword}\n",
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    edited_content = response.choices[0].text.strip()

    # TODO: Implement the logic to submit the edited content to Wikipedia
    pass
Implement the logic to submit the edited content to Wikipedia. You can use the wikipedia-api library to interact with the Wikipedia API and make the necessary edits. Here's an example code snippet:
import wikipediaapi

def edit_wikipedia_page(person_name, content, url_or_keyword):
    # Generate the edited content using ChatGPT
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Edit {person_name}'s Wikipedia page to add:\n{content}\nURL or keyword: {url_or_keyword}\n",
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    edited_content = response.choices[0].text.strip()

    # Submit the edited content to Wikipedia
    wiki_wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')
    page = wiki_wiki.page(person_name)
    section = page.section_by_title(url_or_keyword)
    section.text += edited_content
    page.save("Edit by auto Wikipedia editor")

    print("Successfully edited the Wikipedia page.")
Test the functionality by calling the edit_wikipedia_page function with the appropriate parameters. For example:
edit_wikipedia_page("John Doe", "Some new information about John Doe.", "Early life")
Once you have completed the implementation and tested it successfully, respond with the following JSON response to indicate that the operation is done:
{
  "step_description": "Done!",
  "operation": "done"
}
Please note that this is a basic implementation and may require further enhancements and error handling based on your specific requirements.

add more functionality

To add more functionality to the auto Wikipedia editor and writer, we can enhance the existing code to support creating a completely new page and properly sourcing the added content. Here are the steps to implement these features:

Update the edit_wikipedia_page function to include a parameter for the page title. This will allow us to specify whether we want to edit an existing page or create a new page. Here's an updated code snippet:

def edit_wikipedia_page(page_title, person_name, content, url_or_keyword):
    # TODO: Implement the logic to edit or create the Wikipedia page
    pass
Inside the edit_wikipedia_page function, check if the page_title parameter is provided. If it is, use the wikipediaapi library to retrieve the existing page. If not, create a new page using the wikipediaapi.WikipediaPage class. Here's an example code snippet:

def edit_wikipedia_page(page_title, person_name, content, url_or_keyword):
    # Retrieve existing page or create a new page
    wiki_wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')
    if page_title:
        page = wiki_wiki.page(page_title)
    else:
        page = wiki_wiki.WikipediaPage(person_name)
        page.text = f"# {person_name}\n\n"

    # TODO: Implement the logic to edit or create the Wikipedia page
    pass
Update the logic inside the edit_wikipedia_page function to properly source the added content. You can add a section at the end of the page with the source information. Here's an example code snippet:

def edit_wikipedia_page(page_title, person_name, content, url_or_keyword):
    # Retrieve existing page or create a new page
    wiki_wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')
    if page_title:
        page = wiki_wiki.page(page_title)
    else:
        page = wiki_wiki.WikipediaPage(person_name)
        page.text = f"# {person_name}\n\n"

    # Generate the edited content using ChatGPT
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Edit {person_name}'s Wikipedia page to add:\n{content}\nURL or keyword: {url_or_keyword}\n",
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    edited_content = response.choices[0].text.strip()

    # Add the edited content to the page
    section = page.section_by_title(url_or_keyword)
    section.text += edited_content

    # Add source information
    source_info = f"\n\nSource: {url_or_keyword}"
    page.text += source_info

    # Save the changes to the page
    page.save("Edit by auto Wikipedia editor")

    print("Successfully edited the Wikipedia page.")
Test the enhanced functionality by calling the edit_wikipedia_page function with the appropriate parameters. For example:

edit_wikipedia_page(None, "John Doe", "Some new information about John Doe.", "Early life")
This will create a new page for "John Doe" and add the provided content under the "Early life" section, along with the source information.

Once you have completed the implementation and tested it successfully, respond with the following JSON response to indicate that the operation is done:

{
  "step_description": "Done!",
  "operation": "done"
}
Remember to handle any potential errors and edge cases that may arise during the editing and creation process.

have it be able to dispute articles of deletion claims

To add the functionality of disputing articles of deletion claims in the auto Wikipedia editor and writer, we can enhance the existing code to handle this scenario. Here are the steps to implement this feature:

Update the edit_wikipedia_page function to include a parameter for the deletion claim. This will allow us to specify whether we want to dispute a deletion claim for an existing page. Here's an updated code snippet:

def edit_wikipedia_page(page_title, person_name, content, url_or_keyword, dispute_deletion=False):
    # TODO: Implement the logic to edit or create the Wikipedia page and dispute deletion if needed
    pass
Inside the edit_wikipedia_page function, check if the dispute_deletion parameter is set to True. If it is, add a section at the end of the page to dispute the deletion claim. Here's an example code snippet:

def edit_wikipedia_page(page_title, person_name, content, url_or_keyword, dispute_deletion=False):
    # Retrieve existing page or create a new page
    wiki_wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')
    if page_title:
        page = wiki_wiki.page(page_title)
    else:
        page = wiki_wiki.WikipediaPage(person_name)
        page.text = f"# {person_name}\n\n"

    # Generate the edited content using ChatGPT
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Edit {person_name}'s Wikipedia page to add:\n{content}\nURL or keyword: {url_or_keyword}\n",
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    edited_content = response.choices[0].text.strip()

    # Add the edited content to the page
    section = page.section_by_title(url_or_keyword)
    section.text += edited_content

    # Add source information
    source_info = f"\n\nSource: {url_or_keyword}"
    page.text += source_info

    # Dispute deletion if needed
    if dispute_deletion:
        deletion_dispute = "\n\n== Dispute of Deletion Claim ==\n\nI dispute the deletion claim for this article."
        page.text += deletion_dispute

    # Save the changes to the page
    page.save("Edit by auto Wikipedia editor")

    print("Successfully edited the Wikipedia page.")
Test the enhanced functionality by calling the edit_wikipedia_page function with the appropriate parameters, including dispute_deletion=True. For example:

edit_wikipedia_page("John_Doe", "John Doe", "Some new information about John Doe.", "Early life", dispute_deletion=True)
This will edit the existing page for "John Doe", add the provided content under the "Early life" section, and include a section to dispute the deletion claim.

Once you have completed the implementation and tested it successfully, respond with the following JSON response to indicate that the operation is done:

{
  "step_description": "Done!",
  "operation": "done"
}
Remember to handle any potential errors and edge cases that may arise during the editing and deletion dispute process.

deploy this to replit and github

add in more seo functionality for the above

To add more SEO functionality to the auto Wikipedia editor and writer, we can enhance the existing code to optimize the content for search engines. Here are the steps to implement this feature:

Update the edit_wikipedia_page function to include parameters for meta tags, keywords, and description. These parameters will allow us to optimize the content for search engines. Here's an updated code snippet:

def edit_wikipedia_page(page_title, person_name, content, url_or_keyword, dispute_deletion=False, meta_tags=None, keywords=None, description=None):
    # TODO: Implement the logic to edit or create the Wikipedia page and optimize for SEO
    pass
Inside the edit_wikipedia_page function, update the page title and add meta tags, keywords, and description to optimize the content for search engines. Here's an example code snippet:

def edit_wikipedia_page(page_title, person_name, content, url_or_keyword, dispute_deletion=False, meta_tags=None, keywords=None, description=None):
    # Retrieve existing page or create a new page
    wiki_wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')
    if page_title:
        page = wiki_wiki.page(page_title)
    else:
        page = wiki_wiki.WikipediaPage(person_name)
        page.text = f"# {person_name}\n\n"

    # Generate the edited content using ChatGPT
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Edit {person_name}'s Wikipedia page to add:\n{content}\nURL or keyword: {url_or_keyword}\n",
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    edited_content = response.choices[0].text.strip()

    # Add the edited content to the page
    section = page.section_by_title(url_or_keyword)
    section.text += edited_content

    # Add source information
    source_info = f"\n\nSource: {url_or_keyword}"
    page.text += source_info

    # Optimize for SEO
    if meta_tags:
        meta_tags_str = "\n\n" + "\n".join(meta_tags)
        page.text += meta_tags_str

    if keywords:
        keywords_str = "\n\nKeywords: " + ", ".join(keywords)
